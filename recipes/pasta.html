    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour
         mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes,
          then cooked by boiling or baking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb/500 g dried spaghetti</li>
        <li>10 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp red chilli flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Cook 1lb/500g of dried spaghetti (or any other long dried pasta)
             in a large pot of salted boiling water per packet MINUS 1 minute.</li>
        <li>When pasta is ready, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, and drain pasta.</li>
        <li>Add pasta into chosen sauce with 3/4 cup pasta cooking water.
             Toss pasta until sauce thickens and sticks to pasta (called "emulsifying" the sauce),
              1 - 2 minutes. Use more pasta water if needed to loosen sauce.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Finish pasta per chosen recipe.</li>
