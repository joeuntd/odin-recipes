    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>With a make-ahead dough and a simple sauce, this pizza is an option any night of 
        the week. Just make the dough in the morning; then shape it an hour before you're 
        ready to eat. If homemade dough is not your thing, just buy the premade dough at 
        Trader Joe's or Whole Foods Market, and shape it as you would the scratch dough.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>12 fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) ball Pizza Dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Place Pizza Dough on a large sheet of parchment paper. Cover with a damp towel;
             let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 500°.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle on parchment paper. Crimp edges of dough to 
            form a 1/2-inch border. Slide dough and parchment paper onto a large baking 
            sheet. Place on bottom rack in oven. Bake at 500° for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread Pizza Sauce evenly onto crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with cheese
            slices. Bake an additional 10 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese melts.
            Remove from oven; let stand 5 minutes. Top with basil leaves; cut into wedges.</li>
        <li>Note: If using refrigerated Pizza Dough, let dough rise as directed in step 1 
            for 1 hour. Proceed as directed in recipe.</li>
    </ol>
